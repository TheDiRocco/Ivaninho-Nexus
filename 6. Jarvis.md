The purpose of this project is having a very personnal assisstant with strong and advanced memories feature. I imagine it like being my second brain, a kind of friend to tell him anything and being able to assisst me in anything.
It involves some reflexion on authentication because it could be an easy way to leak important informations.

Key notion : The chat assisstant is a kinf of main agent which has to be able to easily get plugged other agents (other skills)

I m currently familiarizing with Langchain SDK and its subcategories to construct thread and nodes.

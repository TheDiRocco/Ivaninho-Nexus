Coming soon

Developement is starting on 2nd February

Context and why : I wanted to solve a problem of mine by automating the answer to the question : What am I eating tonight ?
The goal is to have a tool knowing my tastes, constraints (budget, time, etc) and suggesting a serie of meal that I 'd like to eat.

Further considerations :
A future feature would be to add an inventory of whats currently at home in stock nor letting an agent browse local supermarket website to get the exact products inlist

The exact architecture is to be exactly designed but here are my current plan :
- Most possible in Azure
- I want to use an ML pipeline for the suggestions engine
- Suggestion by filters only (For ML cold start) 
- Easy and intuitive interface to choose the suggested meal, alternatively a chat assisstant (I want to add both options)
- Semantice retrieving, performed by an agent.
- Using Az AI Search

 I'd like having a very complet dataset of meals and using some embedding features. Maybe vectorizing only the description or having a whole copy of the structured DB in vectors and making an agent retrieving top 100 meal most likely to be choosen and then serving them in the.

 The whole has to be "enterprise" production ready, for experience.
